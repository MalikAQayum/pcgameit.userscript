## Usage and how it works.

**Once PCGI Userscript has been installed, it runs in the background on the store.steampowered.com.**

- Go to any store.steampowered.com related pages or stay on the main page, and it will trigger itself every 20 min on set times of the hour; 
  - minute 7
  - minute 27
  - minute 47 
- let it idle in these specific minutes of the hour, to avoid interupting it, if you are set to be the claimer.
