## Usage and how it works.

**Once PCGI Userscript has been installed, it runs in the background on the store.steampowered.com.**

- Go to any store.steampowered.com related pages or stay on the main page, and it will trigger itself on set times, minute 7, 27, 47 of the hour, every 20 min.
- let it idle in these specific minutes of the hour, to avoid interupting it, if you are set to be the claimer.
